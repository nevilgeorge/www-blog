# nevil george
Hi, I'm Nevil.

I'm in my 5th year as a software engineer at Uber.
I spent my first 3 years working in the Maps domain in San Francisco,
and the rest of my time in Payments.

Prior to Uber, I was an engineering student at Northwestern.

I live in Amsterdam. I've also lived in Maputo, Mbabane, Chicagoland, San Francisco, Oakland.

I'm interested in creating economic opportunity through technology, electronic music and learning about what motivates people. I also enjoy [reading](/readings) widely, and I'm always open to [recommendations](mailto:liven93@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.
