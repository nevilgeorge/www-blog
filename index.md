Hi, I'm __Nevil__.

I work as a software engineer at __Uber__.
I spent my first 3 years working in the Maps domain,
1.5 years in Payments, and now in Pricing.

Prior to Uber, I was an engineering student at __Northwestern__.

I live in __Oakland__. I've also lived in Maputo, Mbabane, Chicagoland, San Francisco, Amsterdam.

I'm interested in creating economic opportunity through technology, exploring electronic music and learning about what motivates people. I also enjoy [reading](/readings) widely, and I'm always open to [recommendations](mailto:liven93@gmail.com){:target="_blank"}.
